# Bank-web-app
A simple bank web app where you can view your balance, request a loan, make transfer.
I created two accounts where you can transfer funds between the two accounts. Login with username: nc, password: 1111 for Nwaeze Charity or username: jm, password: 2222 for Janet Moore. You have 2 minutes to perform transaction and you will be automatically logged out after that, so you will need to login again.
